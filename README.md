## Course Notes

### CSS Architecture

* This project follows [B.E.M rules](http://getbem.com/) to limit cascade and create single-responsibility blocks for making the relationship between HTML and CSS clear

  * B: Block - an independent, reusable part of the design
  ```css
  .large-hero {
   positiion: relative;
  }
  ```
  
  * E: Element (__) - belongs to a block and cannot be used outside of the block it belongs to
  ```css
  .large-hero__title {
   font-weight: 300;
   color: #2f5572;
   font-size: 4.8rem;
  }
  ```
  
  * M: Modifier (--) - can be used on a block or an element to indicate a change to the default state of an object
  ```html
  <a class="btn btn--orange btn--large" ... >
  ```
